# Graphical-Interface-Simulation
Simulating a rasterized graphical interface library in C++ on Windows involves creating a simple rendering framework that mimics how rasterization works in graphical libraries (e.g., OpenGL, DirectX).

This project requires Windows 10 and Visual Studio 2019 for successful compilation and execution. The codebase is written in C++ and requires a minimum C++17 standard for compatibility and proper functionality.
